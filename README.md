This is basically a fun little polyrhythm generator.

A polyrhythm is two or more distinct rhythms played on top of each other, typically forming a unique sounding compound rhythm.

An example is something like 4 against 3, which visually looks a bit like this:

1    2    3    4   1
1      2      3    1

This program let's you play around with ideas like that above and hear them in different tempos with a few drums and shakers.
