This is basically a fun little polyrhythm generator.

A polyrhythm is two or more distinct rhythms played on top of each other, typically forming a unique sounding compound rhythm.

An example is something like 4 against 3, where for every 4 beats of one rhythm, another rhythm will only play 3, but they will match up again every 1st beat.

This program let's you play around with ideas like that above and hear them in different tempos with a few drums and shakers.
